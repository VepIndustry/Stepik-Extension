# Stepik-Extension
This is an extension for alt.stepik.org. There're some features:<br> 
**Firstly**, it replaces useless color theme of knowledge graph on more informative theme.
This allows you to see topics that you're full passed, topics that you're learning and topics that you're not started to solve.<br> 
**Secondly**, it enhances website usability by auto pressing a continue button, when you're learning new topics (it's real useful).
